# Add your project proposal to THE TOP OF THIS README and submit a pull request

## Write a project proposal and get it approved by an instructor

For this project, you will self-organize into groups of 2-6. Together, you will need to come up with a product idea, and write it as a proposal that includes:

* A project description
    * Who uses it?
    * What outputs do they need?
    * What inputs are needed to generate those outputs?
* A list of technologies that you plan to use
* A well-defined and written-out feature list

## Create and deploy a complete fullstack app

Your app should:

* Have a working front-end and back-end
* Use a single-page app framework for the front-end
* Persist data
* Have some authentication
* Use a third-party API
* Use *some significant technology that was not covered in the program*. Examples include:
    * Using Ember, Angular 2, React/Flux etc. on the front-end instead of Angular 1.4
    * Making a native mobile app using a wrapper like ionic framework/React Native/PhoneGap/Cordova etc.
    * Making a desktop app with [Electron](http://electron.atom.io/)/[React Native](https://github.com/ptmt/react-native-desktop) etc.
    * Integrating a physical device/sensor/internet of things
    * Using Rails, Spring, Java, or some other backend framework for building APIs
* All of the quality standards from earlier projects are the same as far as clean code, commit messages, READMEs, etc.
